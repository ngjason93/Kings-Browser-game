Kings Cup - 

A native JavaScript, HTML, CSS responsive website based on the game Kingâ€™s Cup. It was developed primarily for mobile use, including left/right swipe functionality, animations and buttons for non-touch screen devices. I built this project because whenever my friends and I had nostalgia for the game we loved back in college we never had a deck of cards we could play with. Now it's available with a click!
